This project aims to optimize the selection of customers for contact based on historical campaign data. Using a Gradient Boosting Classifier, the model predicts which customers are most likely to result in a profitable outcome when contacted. The model is trained on a dataset, and once trained, it can be used to predict the best customers to contact in future campaigns. This model calculates the expected profit based on customer balance and previous interaction history.
